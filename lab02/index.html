          <h2>
            This Recipe is Created by Malika. It is similar to a traditional
            Russian Roulette Cake. Once you make it, I guarantee you that you'll
            make it a thousand times.

        <h3>Preparing the Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>In a bowl, separate the yellow egg yolk from the clear</li>
          <li>
            Take your mixer and mix the clear egg until it turns very white in
            color and solid in texture to the point that if you were to flip it
            upside down, it would not drip or fall.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you finish mixing the clear eggs, mix the yellow egg yolks in a
            separate bowl with four tablespoons or half a cup of sugar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine the two batters together (yellow egg yolk batter & the clear
            egg batter) and add 3 tablespoons of flour, and a teaspoon of Baking
            Powder, then mix all of that.
          </li>
          <li>Lay your batter on a parchment</li>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 360 degree fahrenheit & leave in the oven for 6-8
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            While your sponge cake batter is in the oven, you can start making
            the cream.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take your Heavy Whipping Cream and pour half of it into a bowl (you
            may use all of it, it is totally up to you.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, take your mixer and mix the cream until it turns solid in
            texture and white in color. Once you're done mixing, add half a cup
            of condensed milk for sweetness and give it another swift mix.
          </li>
          <li>
            That's it! It's that simple! Now you may decorate it however you'd
            like!
          </li>
          <li>
            Once your batter finishes baking, take it out of the oven carefully
            and let it cool down (this should take no longer than 20 minutes- it
            cools down pretty quick)
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, apply the desired amount of cream onto the batter and if you'd
            like, you may add raspberries or any fruit of your choice. Then,
            roll the batter (it should start to look like a wheel). You may
            decorate the top part of the cake with cream. If you'd like, you can
            add a few more raspberries on top or any fruit of your choice!
            (optional)

        This is my favorite recipe because it is super easy to make and it just
        melts away in your tongue! I received so many compliments and it's
        effortless! I've had so many requests from family and friends asking me
        to make it again!! My mother and I used to make this ever since I was
        little so I think I've mastered it by now, haha! I will attach below a
        website that offers free delicious recipes, feel free to check it out!
        Hope you enjoy!
