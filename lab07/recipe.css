          <h3>Preparing the Recipe</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, separate the yellow egg yolk from the clear</li>
            <li>
              Take your mixer and mix the clear egg until it turns very white in
              color and solid in texture to the point that if you were to flip
              it upside down, it would not drip or fall.
            </li>
            <li>
              After mixing the clear eggs, mix the yellow egg yolks in a
              separate bowl with four tablespoons or half a cup of sugar.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combine the two batters together (yellow egg yolk batter & the
              clear egg batter) and add 3 tablespoons of flour, and a teaspoon
              of Baking Powder, then mix all of that.
            </li>
            <li>Lay your batter on a parchment</li>
            <li>
              Preheat oven to 360 degrees Fahrenheit & leave in the oven for 6-8
              minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              While your sponge cake batter is in the oven, you can start making
              the cream.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take your Heavy Whipping Cream and pour half of it into a bowl
              (you may use all of it, it is totally up to you.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, take your mixer and mix the cream until it turns solid in
              texture and white in color. Once you're done mixing, add half a
              cup of condensed milk for sweetness and give it another swift mix.
            </li>
            <li>
              That's it! It's that simple! Now you may decorate it however you'd
              like!
            </li>
            <li>
              Once your batter finishes baking, take it out of the oven
              carefully and let it cool down (this should take no longer than 20
              minutes- it cools down pretty quick)
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, apply the desired amount of cream onto the batter and if
              you'd like, you may add raspberries or any fruit of your choice.
              Then, roll the batter (it should start to look like a wheel). You
              may decorate the top part of the cake with cream. If you'd like,
              you can add a few more raspberries on top or any fruit of your
              choice! (optional)
            </li>
          </ol>
